# Ghostros

## Goal

Main idea is to create a small prototype to practice some game developement principle, and to create some generic tools reusable for futurs projects.  

No real gameplay at all, only some concept and architecture workaround.

## What is done

- Possibility to use animated sprite
- Simple physic and collision systems
- Basic scene management
- Small widget system with layout
